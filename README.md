## Features

### Slide Show

The home page for Sip & Play has a slide show that showcases what Sip & Play looks like. New customers can get a feel
for the business by looking at the slide show. The slide show is interactive and allows users to click on the arrows to
navigate through the images. This slideshow was made using the library `react-slideshow-image'.

### 3D Model Viewer

Sip & Play has a 3D model viewer that allows you to view several 3D models using Three.js. You can rotate the model by
dragging the
mouse, zoom in and out with the scroll wheel, and pan the model by holding the left mouse button. This hopefully
enhances the user experience for new customers!

### Events

Sip & Play has a calendar that shows upcoming events that the business is hosting. This is a great way to keep customers
informed about what's happening at the business. The calendar is interactive and allows users to click on events to view
more information.

### SEO

Sip & Play has implemented SEO best practices to ensure that the site is easily discoverable by search engines. Each
page has its own meta tags, including title, description, and keywords. This helps search engines understand what the
page is about and rank it accordingly.

### Flipbook

As for the menu, Sip & Play has an interactive, 3D flipbook that showcases the menu items. This is a fun way to display
the menu while also providing a unique experience for customers. The flipbook is interactive and allows users to flip
through the pages by clicking on the corners of the pages. It also contains 3D models to further enhance the user
experience.
